title: Using Teleport with OpenSSH
description: This guide shows you how to set up Teleport to enable secure access to OpenSSH servers so you can protect legacy systems that do not run a Teleport binary.

---

In this guide, we will show you how to configure the OpenSSH server `sshd` to
join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of OpenSSH servers can be configured to
accept SSH certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA.

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
`teleport` SSH servers have support for multiple features that are incompatible with OpenSSH:

- RBAC and resource filtering based on [dynamically updated labels](../../management/admin/labels.mdx)
- [Session recording without SSH connection termination](recording-proxy-mode.mdx)
- [Advanced session recording](bpf-session-recording.mdx)
- [Restricting outbound network connections in SSH sessions](restricted-session.mdx)

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSH version 6.9 or above on your local machine. View your OpenSSH version
  with the command:

  ```code
  $ ssh -V
  ```

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux host with the OpenSSH server `sshd` version 7.4 or above installed,
  but not Teleport. The SSH port on this host must be open to traffic from the
  Teleport Proxy Service host.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Add a node resource to your Teleport cluster

When you request an SSH connection to a OpenSSH node, Teleport needs to be able
to find the node's IP address so it can establish a connection to it.

Declare a `node` resource so Teleport knows how to reach your OpenSSH server.
On your local machine, create a file called `openssh-node-resource.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: node
version: v2
sub_kind: openssh
metadata:
  name: a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  addr: 1.2.3.4:22
  hostname: openssh-node
```

`spec.addr` and `spec.hostname` are mandatory. Assign `spec.addr` to the address and port of your node
and `spec.hostname` to the name of the node as you would like users to see it in Teleport.

The `metadata.labels` field labels the SSH Service instance so you can apply RBAC rules to it.

The `metadata.name` field isn't mandatory, but setting it here will save you some work later.

To generate a new universal unique identifier (UUID) suitable for a `node` name, use the `uuidgen`
on Linux or MacOS, or use the `New-Guid` cmdlet in Powershell on Windows.

Create the node resource:

```code
$ tctl create openssh-node-resource.yaml
```

## Step 2/5. Configure `sshd` to trust the Teleport CA

Later in this guide, we will generate an SSH client configuration that will use
a certificate signed by the Teleport Auth Service to authenticate to your SSH
server. For this to work, `sshd` must be told to allow users to log in with
certificates generated by the Teleport Auth Service.

Start by exporting the Teleport CA public key.

On the host where you are running `sshd`, run the following commands, assigning <Var name="proxy" /> to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
$ export KEY=$(curl 'https://<Var name="proxy"/>/webapi/auth/export?type=openssh' | sed "s/cert-authority\ //")
```

Make the public key accessible to `sshd`:

```code
$ sudo bash -c "echo \"$KEY\" > /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub"
$ sudo bash -c "echo 'TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
```

Restart `sshd`. For systemd-enabled hosts, run the following command:

```code
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Now, `sshd` will trust users who present a Teleport-issued certificate.

## Step 3/5. Configure host authentication

Next, ask Teleport to issue a valid host certificate for your `sshd` host. Later
in this guide, we will configure your SSH client to trust the certificate,
authenticating your `sshd` host for your SSH client. Like the user certificate
we created earlier, the host certificate will be signed by the Teleport Auth
Service.

### Ensure that your user has the correct privileges

Your user must be authorized to read and write host certificates.

On your local machine, create a file called `host-certifier.yaml` with the
following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: host-certifier
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources:
          - host_cert
        verbs:
          - list
          - create
          - read
          - update
          - delete
```

Create the role resource:

```code
$ tctl create host-certifier.yaml
# role 'host-certifier' has been created
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="host-certifier"!)

You will now have the required permissions to export a host key for your `sshd`
host.

### Issue a host certificate

<Details title="Find your node's UUID">

When you created a `node` resource and if you didn't set the `metadata.name` field earlier,
the Teleport Auth Service generated a universal unique identifier (UUID) for that node.
Teleport Proxy Services uses the UUID to differentiate nodes with the same hostname, so
it must be added to the host certificate. To find your node's UUID, first determine if its hostname is unique:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node --format text
```

If only one node is displayed and you have `jq` installed, you can run the
following command to get your node's UUID:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node --format=json | jq -r ".[0].metadata.name"
```

Otherwise, find your node's UUID in the `metadata.name` field of the YAML
output of this command:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node
```

</Details>

#### Create the host certificate

When creating host certificates, it is important to specify all the domain names
and addresses that refer to your node. If you try to connect to a node with a
name or address that was not specified when creating it's host certificate,
Teleport will reject the SSH connection.

On your local machine, assign the IP address, fully qualified domain name of
your node, and the node's UUID to an environment variable. If you won't be
connecting to your node with its hostname, you can safely omit it.

```code
$ ADDR=1.2.3.4,openssh-node,a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
```

Run the following `tctl` command to generate a host certificate:

```code
$ tctl auth sign \
      --host=${ADDR?} \
      --format=openssh \
      --out=myhost

# The credentials have been written to myhost, myhost-cert.pub
```

The above command will result in a private key and certificate.

<Details title="Issuing certificates for multiple hosts">

To generate certificates for multiple hosts, assign the `host` flag to a
comma-separated list of addresses. Certificates for wildcard domains are not
supported by OpenSSH, so each domain must be fully qualified.

</Details>

Use `ssh-keygen` to verify the contents of the certificate:

```code
$ ssh-keygen -L -f myhost-cert.pub
```

The `Principals` section should contain the address you assigned to `ADDR`
earlier:

```
myhost-cert.pub:
        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com host certificate
        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:nHkp6SnrAW4AV00VUaqPgR6SgdyvV9MmjUrYnwZ779A
        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:euqx2Y8Pq+r0c94GKVNXAklBVTmAJtaQUn3/ehrfEJE (using rsa-sha2-512)
        Key ID: ""
        Serial: 0
        Valid: after 2022-04-22T11:14:16
        Principals:
                1.2.3.4
                openssh-node
                a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
        Critical Options: (none)
        Extensions:
                x-teleport-authority UNKNOWN OPTION (len 33)
                x-teleport-role UNKNOWN OPTION (len 8)
```

Copy the host key and certificate to your `sshd` host, placing them in the
directory `/etc/ssh`.

Make sure these files have the correct permissions:

```code
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Then add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on your `sshd` host:

```yaml
HostKey /etc/ssh/myhost
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Restart `sshd`.

## Step 4/5. Generate an SSH client configuration

The next step is to configure your OpenSSH client to connect to your `sshd` host
using credentials managed by Teleport. This configuration will use your user's
Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate to the `sshd` host. It will also
authenticate the `sshd` host using the host certificate you generated earlier.

First, make sure you have logged in to your Teleport cluster:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor, host-certifier
  Logins:             ubuntu, root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-05-06 22:54:01 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h53m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
  Logged in as:       myuser
  Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor, host-certifier
  Logins:             ubuntu, root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2022-05-06 22:54:01 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h53m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

</ScopedBlock>

On your local machine, run the following `tsh` command. This will print a
configuration block that tells your SSH client to use credentials managed by
Teleport to connect to hosts in your cluster.

```code
$ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
```

This command creates an SSH configuration file at a nonstandard location in
order to make it easier to clean up, but you can append the output of
`tsh config` to the default SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) if you wish.

<Details title="How does the config work?">

Teleport implements an SSH server that includes several **subsystems**, or
predefined commands that are run when the server handles a connection. The Proxy
Service implements a `proxy` subsystem that forwards SSH traffic to remote hosts
and Trusted Clusters.

Here is a brief explanation of the configuration that `tsh config` generates:

```
# Common flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} {{ .ProxyHost }}
    UserKnownHostsFile "{{ .KnownHostsPath }}"
    IdentityFile "{{ .IdentityFilePath }}"
    CertificateFile "{{ .CertificateFilePath }}"
```

If the host you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster (i.e., its
address is a subdomain of your cluster's domain), use a Teleport-managed known
hosts file, private key, and certificate that are stored in the `.tsh`
directory.

```
# Flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts except the proxy
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} !{{ .ProxyHost }}
    Port 3022
    ProxyCommand "{{ .TSHPath }}" proxy ssh --cluster={{ .ClusterName }} --proxy={{ .ProxyHost }} %r@%h:%p
```

If the host that you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster, the
OpenSSH client will first execute a command, the `ProxyCommand`, that
establishes an SSH connection to the Proxy Service. This command,
`tsh proxy ssh`, requests the `proxy` subsystem in order to forward SSH traffic
through the Proxy Service to your chosen host (including a host in a Trusted
Cluster).

The `tsh proxy ssh` command requests the `proxy` subsystem through a command
similar to the following, which assumes you are logging in to a node called
`mynode` as `root` with a cluster called `teleport.example.com`:

```code
$ /usr/bin/ssh -l root -A -o UserKnownHostsFile=/root/.tsh/known_hosts -p 11105 teleport.example.com -s proxy:mynode:3022@teleport.example.com
```

Notice that the `known_hosts` file used by the command is managed by `tsh`.
Since the `sshd` host's information is listed in this file, your SSH client can
authenticate the host via the certificate we generated earlier.

<Details title="Using PowerShell on Windows?">

  If using PowerShell on Windows, note that normal shell redirection may write
  the file with the incorrect encoding. To ensure it's written properly, try the
  following:

  ```code
  $ tsh.exe config | out-file .ssh\config -encoding utf8 -append
  ```

</Details>

<Details title="Experiencing latency in leaf cluster nodes?">

### Proxy Jump

In the generated OpenSSH client configuration, the `ProxyCommand` for each leaf
cluster connects through the root cluster's Proxy Service. In scenarios where
leaf cluster Proxy Services are reachable by SSH client, you might prefer to
connect directly through the leaf proxies for lower latency.

To enable direct connections to a Proxy Service in a leaf cluster, open the
SSH configuration file you generated earlier and update the `ProxyCommand`
of the leaf cluster's configuration block to use the leaf Proxy Service as
a jumphost, using the `-J` flag.

```txt
Host *.{{ .nodeName }}.leaf1.example.com
   Port 3022
   ProxyCommand tsh proxy ssh -J proxy.leaf1.example.com:443 %r@%h:%p
```

### Proxy Templates

With Proxy Templates, `tsh` will dynamically determine the address of the
Proxy Service to connect to based on the address of the destination
host in your `ssh` command.

To use Proxy Templates, add `-J {{proxy}}` to the `ProxyCommand` line in
your `~/.ssh/config`.

```txt
Host *.example.com
   Port 3022
   ProxyCommand tsh proxy ssh -J {{proxy}} %r@%h:%p
```

Then, add `proxy_templates` to your `tsh` configuration file (`~/.tsh/config/config.yaml`
or a global `/etc/tsh.yaml`).

```yaml
proxy_templates:
- template: '^(\w+)\.(leaf1\.example\.com):([0-9]+)$'
  proxy: "$2:443"
```

`tsh proxy ssh -J {{proxy}}` will attempt to match the host server address `%h:%p` with the
configured templates. If there is a match, then the jump proxy address `{{proxy}}` will
be replaced using the template's `proxy` field and the host server address `%h:%p` will be
replaced using the template's `host` field if set.

| Field      | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `template` | (Required) Regular expression that the host server address `%h:%p` is matched against. |
| `proxy`    | (Required) Proxy Service address to use for proxy jump. Can reference capturing groups from the regular expression in `template` (e.g., `$1` or `$2`). |
| `host`     | (Optional) Host Server address to connect to. Can reference capturing groups from the regular expression in `template` (e.g., `$1` or `$2`). Defaults to full host spec `%h:%p`. |

### Example configuration

```yaml
proxy_templates:
- template: '^(\w+)\.(leaf1\.example\.com):([0-9]+)$'
  proxy: "$2:443"
- template: '^(\w+)\.(leaf2\.example\.com):([0-9]+)$'
  proxy: "$2:3080"
  host: "$1:$3"
- template: '(\w+(\.\w+)*)\.(example\.com):([0-9]+)$'
  proxy: "leaf1.example.com:443"
  host: "$1:22"

Given the configuration above, the following command will connect to the node
`node-1.leaf1.example.com:3022` through the Proxy Service `leaf1.example.com:443`:

```code
$ ssh root@node-1.leaf1.example.com
```

The following command will connect to the node `node-1:3022` through the Proxy Service
`leaf2.example.com:3080`:

```code
$ ssh root@node-1.leaf2.example.com
```

The last template can be used to connect to openssh hosts with their own FQDN.
For example, you can connect to the host `openssh.external.com:22` through the
Proxy Service `leaf1.example.com:443` with the following command:

```code
$ ssh root@openssh.external.com.example.com
```

</Details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Multiple Clusters"
>

  If you switch between multiple Teleport Proxy Servers, you'll need to re-run
  `tsh config` for each to generate the cluster-specific configuration.

  Similarly, if Trusted Clusters are added or removed, be sure to re-run
  `tsh config` and replace the previous configuration.

</Admonition>

## Step 5/5. Connect to your `sshd` host

Once you have appended the new text to your OpenSSH client configuration file,
you can log in to your `sshd` host using the configuration we generated earlier.

First, define environment variables for the address of your Teleport cluster,
the username you will use to log in to your `sshd` host, and the port on your
`sshd` host you are using for SSH traffic:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=teleport.example.com
$ PORT=22
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ PORT=22
```

</ScopedBlock>

Next, SSH in to your remote host:

```code
$ ssh -p ${PORT?} -F ssh_config_teleport "${USER?}@${ADDR?}.${CLUSTER?}"
```

This name does not need to be resolvable via DNS as the connection will be
routed through your Teleport Proxy Service.

<Details title="Why are we overriding the port here?">

By default, the OpenSSH client configuration generated by `tsh config` directs
the Teleport Proxy Service to dial port 3022 of a node in your Teleport cluster.
This works if the node's SSH Service is listening on port 3022, and means that
you can connect to the Teleport SSH Service via your OpenSSH client.

 When you join a Teleport node to a cluster, the node creates a reverse tunnel
 to the cluster's Proxy Service. When you run an `ssh` command to access a host
 in your Teleport cluster using the configuration we generated, the Teleport
 Proxy Service will attempt to connect to the host via this reverse tunnel and,
 if that fails, try directly dialing the address.

In our case, the `sshd` host is not running Teleport, so no reverse tunnel will
exist. Instead, the Proxy Service will establish a direct connection on the
host's SSH port.

</Details>

<Details title="Using Trusted Clusters?">

You can log in to a host in a Trusted Cluster by placing the name of the cluster
between the name of the node and the name of your root Teleport cluster:

```code
$ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport ${USER?}@node2.leafcluster.${CLUSTER}
```

</Details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>

  Teleport uses OpenSSH certificates instead of keys. When you connect to a
  remote host, OpenSSH verifies that the address of the host is listed under the
  `Principals` section of the OpenSSH certificate. Usually, this is a fully
  qualified domain name, rather than an IP address.

</Admonition>

## Revoke an SSH certificate

Teleport's approach to using short-lived certificates for all infrastructure
access means that it can generate large numbers of certificates every day. For
this reason, Teleport does not support traditional certificate revocation.

There are two options available for revoking access: CA rotations, and Teleport locks.

### CA Rotations

To generate a new certificate authority and invalidate user certificates issued
by the current CA, run `tctl auth rotate --type-user`. This process will require
that the newly generated CA certificate is uploaded to your entire fleet of
OpenSSH servers. This can be a disruptive change, especially in environments
that lack automation, so proceed with caution.

### Locks

Teleport locks allow you to permanently or temporarily revoke access to a number
of different "targets". Supported lock targets include: specific users, roles,
servers, desktops, or MFA devices. When a lock is created any existing sessions
where the lock applies will be terminated, and new sessions will be rejected while
the lock remains in force.

For more information, read our
[Session and Identity Locking Guide](../../access-controls/guides/locking.mdx).
