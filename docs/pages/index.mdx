Teleport is an identity-aware, multi-protocol access proxy. Teleport understands
the SSH, HTTPS, RDP, Kubernetes API, MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL wire
protocols, plus many others. It can integrate with Single Sign-On providers and
enables you to apply access policies using infrastructure-as-code and GitOps
tools.

<Notice type="info">

If your organization is already using Teleport and you want to learn how to
access infrastructure, read our [Connect your
Client](./connect-your-client/introduction.mdx) guides for instructions.

</Notice>

## Get started

See how Teleport works by [spinning up a demo cluster](./get-started.mdx) on a
Linux server, which you can use to protect infrastructure in your home lab. You
can also get started right away with a production-ready Teleport cluster by
signing up for a [free trial of Teleport Team](https://goteleport.com/signup/).

Once your usage grows, you can upgrade from Teleport Team to Teleport Enterprise
Cloud. For large organizations with specific needs, you can also get started
with self-hosted Teleport Enterprise. Read our [Choose an
Edition](./choose-an-edition/introduction.mdx) section to learn more.

## Set up secure access

Once you are running a Teleport cluster, you can enroll your infrastructure and
configure RBAC by applying dynamic resources with Terraform, Helm, or the `tctl`
CLI tool. Read more in the [Dynamic
Resources](dynamic-resources/introduction.mdx) section.

You can use dynamic resources to define RBAC roles and Single Sign-On
connectors. You can also set up Access Requests to enable just-in-time access to
your infrastructure. Read the [Access
Management](./access-controls/introduction.mdx) section to get started.

## Enroll your infrastructure

You can enable secure access to servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and
other infrastructure resources by deploying and configuring Teleport agents. 

Read about how to join agents to your cluster in the in the [Teleport
Agents](./agents/introduction.mdx) section.

Once you have deployed Teleport agents, you can enroll your infrastructure by
applying dynamic resources or editing each agent's static configuration file.
Read more about adding specific resources to your Teleport cluster:

- [Servers](./server-access/getting-started.mdx), including OpenSSH servers that
  [do not have Teleport installed](./server-access/guides/openssh.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](./kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](./database-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Applications](./application-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Windows desktops](./desktop-access/introduction.mdx)

You can also set up [Machine ID](./machine-id/introduction.mdx) to enable
service accounts to access resources in your infrastructure with short-lived
credentials.

- **Day Two Operations:** [Regular administrative
  tasks](./management/introduction.mdx) such as upgrades, backups, and scaling.
- **Self-Hosted Clusters:** If Teleport Team and Teleport Enterprise Cloud do
  not address your organization's specific needs, you can run the Teleport Auth
  Service and Proxy Service yourself. Learn how to deploy a [high-availability
  production Teleport cluster](./deploy-a-cluster/introduction.mdx).
- **Reference:** [Comprehensive lists](./reference/introduction.mdx) of
  configuration options, CLI flags, and more. 
- **Architecture:** Detailed explanations of [how Teleport
  works](./architecture/introduction.mdx).
- **API:** Write custom workflows that respond to Teleport cluster events and
  manage dynamic resources using [Teleport's gRPC API](./api/introduction.mdx).
