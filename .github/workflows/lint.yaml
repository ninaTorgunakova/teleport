      # The `buf breaking` check is twofold: we always check for compatibility
      # breaks against the base of the PR, and in backports we check for
      # compatibility breaks _from_ the tip of master. It's possible to add
      # fields just to release branches and not master, but it requires
      # reserving the appropriate field numbers and field names in master (as it
      # should!).

      # We run a separate fetch because even with a fetch-depth of 0 in
      # actions/checkout I'm not sure that we're guaranteed to have all the refs
      # we need (especially the tip of master in backports), but it's a shallow
      # fetch for a specific tree by hash, so it should be pretty fast.
