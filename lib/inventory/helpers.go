// ninthRampingJitter modifies a jitter, applying a linear ramp-up effect to a jitter s.t. the
// first ~n jitters ramp up linearly from 1/9th the base duration to the full base duration.
// For example, say an operation typically uses FullJitter(5m) for backoff. Applying this
// modifier with n=100 would cause the first backoff to be on the range of 0-45s, the 50th
// backoff to be on the range of 0-3m, and so on, with the jitter behaving normally after the
// first 100 calls.
//
// The actual use-case here is pretty niche, we currently only use this for one thing: having
// the first few hundred inventory connections have a shorter initial announce period. This is
// a placeholder until we can get proper dynamically scaling announce rates in place.
